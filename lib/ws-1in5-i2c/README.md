# WS 1inch5 i2c Library
A library for interfacing with a [Waveshare 1.5 Inch OLED](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/1.5inch_OLED_Module) over i2c. The library assumes the screen is mounted upside down.

This library supports drawing images and text to the screen using the [rusttype crate](https://crates.io/crates/rusttype), [image crate](https://crates.io/crates/image), and [imageproc crate](https://crates.io/crates/imageproc). 

## Example
```rust
let screen = WS1in5::new(30, 1, 27).unwrap();
screen.clear_all().unwrap();
```
